# Christmas_Challenge
Taking Christmas season as an inspirational theme challenge for my final project (Fall 2021). The challenge involves 2 parts: (1) Analyze Christmas dataset and create fun, animated plots; (2) Create a personal website. The second part of this challenge is currently in maintenance for further feature upgrading.
