- __Name__: **Binh Minh An Nguyen**

Butâ€¦ please call me An or Minh An (/mi:ng a:n/). I did not intend to take any English name at first, and still have no plan in the future, even though there are bunches of funny stories about my name. When I came to the US, most of my Professors and classmates, who I barely talk to, usually call me as Binh. Not that bad, but Binh is actually my middle name. Question that I receive all time is that why did I place my middle name in front of my first name? Long story short, it is because of the complex name structure in Asia versus Westerner.

- __Occupation__: currently 100% Full-time Student plus 30% on-campus Intern at the Data Quality team, Division of Development & Alumni Relations

## Fun Facts

My friends use to describe my career path is like a bunch of pasta with many types of toppings but none is meatballs. When I was a kid, I thought that I would become a historian or a religion researcher. My first book at the age of 8 was about the human being history of 5000 years. I fell in love with these historical books and always felt peace from within. However, life has always been unexpected rides. From a dream of becoming a historian, I ended up at a Business school in Singapore and almost settled my life with the Accounting professions.

Nevertheless, my curiosity and adventurousness took over and drove me toward Data Science path, at which I feel much more freely to stay true to myself, interests, weirdness, and creativity. Getting a job in DS/DA might be a reward but not a real motivation. In fact, I am more in love with the journey of becoming who I am now and step-by-step to possibly be a Data Scientist in the future.


## Other Interests

Parallel and somewhat conflicting with the DS path, I am an intuitive person. But who can lean toward science only? Living intuitively is embracing feminine energy, while learning science represents the masculine side. In Taoism, a person only finds herself at peace when Yin is balanced with Yang, Yin within Yang, and Yang within Yin.

I love meditation and meditation indeed changes my life. Outside of the classroom, I practice and develop energy healing, meditation guidance, art therapy, etc., research about the extra-terrestrial, and discuss on how to balance science against spirituality.
